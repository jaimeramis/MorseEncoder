# MorseEncoder
Python - Scripting - MorseEncoder

# Functionality:
This program allows you to convert words or phrases into Morse code. It uses a dictionary loaded from a JSON file that maps characters to the corresponding Morse code. The user inputs a word or phrase, and the program returns the translation to Morse code.

# Features:
- Text encoding into Morse code.
- Only valid characters according to a predefined dictionary in the data.json file are accepted.
- Interactive terminal interface.
- Option to restart or exit the program.

# Requirements:
To run the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Also, make sure the data.json file is present in the same directory as the Python file, as it contains the character table and its Morse code equivalent.

# Project Structure:
- main.py: The main file containing the program's logic.
- data.json: The data file containing the dictionary of characters and their Morse code equivalents.

# Installation:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Verify that the data.json file is present in the same directory as the main file.
4. Run main.py
